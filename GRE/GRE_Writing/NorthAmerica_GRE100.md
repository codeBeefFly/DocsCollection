#### Title: AE1: Argument 2: The function of cortisol: <P299>

Card: ==========================

```
The following appeared as part of a letter to the editor of a scientific journal.

"A recent study of eighteen rhesus monkeys provides cludes as to the effects of birth order on an individual's levels of stimulation. The study showed that in stimulating situations (such as an encounter with an unfamiliar monkey), firstborn infant monkeys produce up to twice as much of the hormone cortisol, which primes the body for increased activity levels, as do their younger siblings. Firstborn humans also produce relatively high levels of cortisol in stimulating situations (such as the return of a parent after an absence). The study also found that during pregnancy, first-time mother monkeys had higher levels of cortisol than did those who had had several offspring."

Requirement: ====================

```
Write a response in which you discuss one or more alternative explanations that could rival the proposed explanation and explain how your explanation(s) can plausibly account for the facts presented in the argument.

Answer: ========================

```
Basing on a study which showed that firstborn infant monkeys produce much more cortisol than their younger siblings do in stimulating situations, the writer therefore suggests that the birth order may affect an individual's levels of stimulation. However, there are other hypotheses that can rival the writer's explanation. Without further studies to rule out other possibilities, I cannot hastily accept the writer's claim.

The most important point worth noticing is that the sample and the situation of the study are both selective and limited. Only 18 individual monkeys were studied, thus it is quite possible that the reliability of the study was severely weakend by the limited number of subjects, and the result of the study may not apply to other individuals or species. Also, the study observed only limited situations of stimulation (namely, encountering with unfamiliar monkeys and returning of parents). Whether the level of cortisol secretion will also be significantly different among siblings under other stimulating condition is open to doubt. Chances are, the secretion of cortisol only governs activities in certain stimulating situations (such as those studied above) while is of no use under other conditions.

On the other hand, although the levels of cortisol of those subjects vary in stimulating situations, I cannot conclude that the hormone is the only explanation for the increased activities. Such activities may also result from differences between the firstborns and their siblings other than the level of cortisol. One possible explanation is that their genes may differ conspicuously, which leads to their different responses to stimulation. The disparity in the nurturing of firstborns and their siblings could also account for the result. Perhaps the firstborns receive much more attention from their parents than their siblings do so that they react more strongly when they are stimulated. 

Regarding the last piece of evidence, i.e. the higher levels of cortisol among first-time mother monkeys during pregnancy. I cannot see any relation between the hormone levels of mothers and those of their offspring, not to mention the effect of the hormone levels on their children's levels of activity under stimulation. Unless the writer can provide concrete evidence that there is direct connection between the physical condition of mothers and that of their children, this piece of evidence can be regarded as logically irrelevant. 

In summary, merely a study on limited sample can hardly ensuere an informed conclusion about the decisive factor of an individual's level of stimulation. Also, it would be improper to generalize from certain primate species to the condition of all other species. Some in-depth studies which include more subjects of more species, or controlled studies are necessary to make sure what factor(s) really dominate the different reactions of individuals to stimulation.
