# 0. initial look up strategy

to get better understanding of Aitronx TSP processor_node execution mechanisms, we have first to look up some readme.md files throughout the entire TauristarPlatform repositories, and trying to run and debug the example and demo files using gdb/cgbd. 



there are two sets of codes that we need to familiarize with, code for ROS and Non-ROS (processor_node), in this article, we focus on the Non-ROS part. but that does not mean we should not read  ROS related documents.
