[toc]

## 1. briefing:

We are going to do some modifications on our current path planning and parking algorithm to fit x3 and byd platform. 



The date of transporting our vehicle is set to **26th July** for the time being. We have two time slots for the above work **20th ~ 26th July** and **27th ~ 29th July**. 



My suggestion for completing it would be optimizing the code on IC421 and transforming it to x3-byd along with testing before 26th July and exhibition site testing thereafter. 



Our business group have requested the organizer to reserve three-row empty vertical slots for our demonstration, rely status unknown. I think we also need our group to get the measurement of the site slots, which include but not limited to lenght, with, lane_with etc..
